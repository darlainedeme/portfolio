                <p>I've recently been exploring the very useful and completely open data provided by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). Using this comprehensive geospatial dataset (available in .csv format), you can visualize and analyze conflict events across Africa from 1997 to 2024.</p>
                <p>The data reveals a trend of increasing conflict events over the past decade, with significant spikes during certain years. For instance, the year 1999 saw exceptionally high fatalities due to the Second Congo War, while the period between 2011 and 2014 experienced surges in violence related to the Libyan Civil War and Boko Haram insurgency. More recently, from 2017 to 2023, ongoing conflicts in the Sahel, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo have continued to dominate the landscape.</p>
                <p>The impact of COVID-19 has also been notable, with the pandemic period witnessing a rise in protests and civil unrest across various African countries, highlighting the strains on societal structures and governance challenges. Significant protests in North Africa, including Algeria's Hirak movement and economic protests in Tunisia, have marked the post-2020 period. In recent years, there has been a marked rise in violent events, particularly in the Horn of Africa and the Lake Chad Basin. In more recent news, Senegal has seen substantial protests in the last months.</p>
                <p>There is an urgent need for effective conflict resolution mechanisms and robust governance structures. To achieve its ambitions, Africa must address the root causes of violence and promote effective governance to work towards peace and stability.</p>
